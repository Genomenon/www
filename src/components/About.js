        <p>Startup Detroit is for the makers, creators, investors, and supporters in the software and tech startup space building and investing in innovation in and around metro Detroit.
        <p>Communities thrive when the are they open and inclusive. Open source is an excellent model to make this work.</p>
        <p>Our goal of #StartupDetroit is to create a brand owned by the community, not owned by anyone one organization.</p>
        <p>To build an inclusive community, we want startups, investors, and supporting organziations and companies to be invited to participate. We do not want to limit participation by location. Rather, #StartupDetroit is for the startups, investors, and supporting organizations in Detroit, around metro Detroit, and around the world that want to see this region thrive.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your support!</p>
